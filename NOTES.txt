NEXT STEPS:


- do next:


give each entity a Mediator to broadcast events only to itself???

Add tracing messages that are rebroadcast, number of listeners and list of them, ability to turn logging on/off

add camera that follows the player (scrolls the map and other entities around the player)
add proper player movement using physics, velocity, etc

add physics logic with a loop that is passed the list of all game entities. No gravity for now, but can add later. 

player registeres move event that causes the listening map to move?
player has a moveTO function like grave peril?


- Make the map / payer movement and animation work on events / messages

- Need to be able to pass listeners and callbacks back to the mediator when a message is sent from it
- test the message system a lot

-- 

- MAKE ALL THIS BASED ON THE MESSAGE SYSTEM
- Basic player movement (tap to move only or hold to move?)
- Basic tile map meta data layer read in (movement only)
- Player movement based on tile map meta data
-
