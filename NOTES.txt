NEXT STEPS:


- do next:


add an unregister self callback to all entities to allow them to be unregistered after having other callbacks performed on themselves properly
send event to mediator with arguments (touch position, map touch position, tile GID, ETC) to player
player registeres move event that causes the listening map to move?
player has a moveTO function like grave peril?

- Make an event class to replace SCListeners when not a listener
- Make SCListener an extension of Events? or do Listneers get and event?

- Make the map / payer movement and animation work on events / messages

- Need to be able to pass listeners and callbacks back to the mediator when a message is sent from it
- test the message system a lot

-- 

- MAKE ALL THIS BASED ON THE MESSAGE SYSTEM
- Basic player movement (tap to move only)
- Basic tile map meta data layer read in (movement only)
- Player movement based on tile map meta data
-
