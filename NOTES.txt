NEXT STEPS:


- do next:

read in tile map properties (probably based on where the player is and touch) CHECK HOPPY

Physics Working (CHECK HOPPY)

give each entity a Mediator to broadcast events only to itself???

Add tracing messages that are rebroadcast, number of listeners and list of them, ability to turn logging on/off

add proper player movement using physics, velocity, etc

add physics logic with a loop that is passed the list of all game entities. No gravity for now, but can add later. 


player has a moveTO function like grave peril?


- Make the map / payer movement and animation work on events / messages

- Need to be able to pass listeners and callbacks back to the mediator when a message is sent from it
- test the message system a lot

-- 

- MAKE ALL THIS BASED ON THE MESSAGE SYSTEM
- Basic player movement (tap to move only or hold to move?)
- Basic tile map meta data layer read in (movement only)
- Player movement based on tile map meta data
-
